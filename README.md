# Buonanno Prints

## Description

This project is in development. I am working on creating a print gallery for a private collector of Italian Renaissance architectural prints. When an individual print listing is clicked, the user is taken taken to a "/details" view, where more information about the selected print is displayed. From "/details," the user has the ability to edit the listing and update the Title and Description of the selected print.
